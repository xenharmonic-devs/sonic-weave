# SonicWeave - Technical overview
This documentation describes the SonicWeave DSL as it relates to other programming languages.

## Type system
Values in SonicWeave fall into these categories

| Type     | Example                  | Notes                                                                |
| -------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| None     | `niente`                 | _Niente_ is used in music notation and means _nothing_ in Italian.   |
| String   | `'hello'`                | Both single and double quoted strings are supported. Used for note labels.                  |
| Color    | `#ff00ff`                | CSS colors, short hexadecimal, and long hexadecimal colors supported. Used for note colors. |
| Boolean  | `true` or `false`        | Converted to `1` or `0` inside scales.                               |
| Interval | `7/5`                    | There are many kinds of intervals with their own operator semantics. |
| Val      | `12@`                    | Used to convert scales in just intonation to equal temperaments.     |
| Array    | `[5/4, P5, 9\9]`         | Musical scales are represented using arrays of intervals.            |
| Record   | `{fif: 3/2, "p/e": 2}`   | Associative data indexed by strings.                                 |
| Function | `riff plusOne(x) {x+1}`  | _Riff_ is a music term for a short repeated phrase.                  |

Array and record types are recursive i.e. arrays may contain other arrays or records and the values of records can be anything.

SonicWeave does not have classes and there's no `value.property` syntax.

The language is weakly typed and weakly valued. Logdivision is particularly leaky: `16 /_ 8` is rational `4/3` but `16 /_ 3` evaluates to a real (floating point) number. However most expressions that can be expressed as a radical (nth root) are exact.

## Operator precedence

The following table summarizes the operator precedence in SonicWeave, from highest precedence (most binding) to lowest precedence (least binding). Operators in the same box have the same precedence.

All operations are left-associative except exponentiation, recipropower, and logdivision (marked with an asterisk *).

Parenthesis, `^`, `×`, `÷`, `+`, `-` follow [PEMDAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations). The fraction slash `/` represents vertically aligned fractions similar to `$\frac{3}{2}^\frac{1}{2}$` in LaTeX e.g. `3/2 ^ 1/2` evaluates to `sqrt(3 ÷ 2)`.

[^1]: `lest` is a fully associative operation, thus `a() lest b() lest c()` = `(a() lest b()) lest c()` = `a() lest (b() lest c())`. This means that one can always treat a sequence `a() lest b() lest ... lest c()` as if the evaluations occurred from left to right. Any possible parenthesis may be ignored in such a sequence.
