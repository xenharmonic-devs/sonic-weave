"Lemba[10] notated using variables"

(* Generate justly intoned nominals *)
(* Prefer stacking 8/7, but stack one down to make M = 7/4 *)
const nominals = rank2(8/7, 3, 1)

(* Destructure nominals into individual variables *)
const [J, K, L, M, N] = nominals

(* The period is a semioctave notated using ^K *)
^ = sqrt(2) / K

(* Work around limitations of the grammar *)
const [vJ, vK, vL, vM, vN] = v{nominals}

(* Temper to 26-tone equal temperament (with minimal loss in accuracy) *)
